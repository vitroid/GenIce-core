# GenIce-core

Core algorithms of GenIce2

version 0.8


## Requirements

* numpy
* networkx



## Installation

GenIce-core is registered to [PyPI (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GenIce).
Install with pip3.

    pip3 install genice-core

## Uninstallation

    pip3 uninstall genice-core

## API

API manual is [here](https://vitroid.github.io/GenIce-core).

## Examples

Make an ice graph from a given undirected graph.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib
import genice_core

# np.random.seed(12345)

g = nx.dodecahedral_graph()  # dodecahedral 20mer
pos = nx.spring_layout(g)

# set orientations of the hydrogen bonds.
dg = genice_core.ice_graph(g)

nx.draw_networkx(dg, pos)
```
